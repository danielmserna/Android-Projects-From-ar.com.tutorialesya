When I was studying Android Studio, I followed Diego Moisset's tutorials, however, the PDF provided
by him did not contain the links to the projects that are developed in the document. So I thought it
would be relevant to upload them to my Github profile. I have to warn that many of the projects have
additional features that I added while learning. The topic I liked the most to learn was SQLite.  
The document can be found here as "Android Studio Course". His page 
is https://www.tutorialesprogramacionya.com/acercade.html
